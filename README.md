# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Introduction

This project aimed to build the back end for an e-commerce site and configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## Technologies

There are few npm packages that are required to run this application and they are [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.


## Mock-Up

A walkthrough video shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia and it is available through the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a3AywvrYJpFUe6dbNnKCV97SnTQFOJXx/view


The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia:

![In Insomnia, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/13-orm-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia:

## Technical Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
